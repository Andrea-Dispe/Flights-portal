# Flights Portal exercise

This project was made to practice with React and fetching API data.

The User has 2 ways to select the departure and arrival airports: through the text fields on the top or by clicking the corresponding tag under the text fields.



#### Tech stack:

- React
- Material UI



#### Note 24/09/2021

Today I noticed there is a new bug with the tags  that do not work properly when clicked. Will fix it soon.
